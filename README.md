# Hello! I'm Guadalupe Redondo, a Junior Full Stack programmer. I'm passionate about design and enjoy merging creativity with the logic of code.

💻  I'm working on developing projects as a freelancer.

📚 Currently, I'm learning about UI design and SEO to apply it to my projects.

🏊‍♀️ Outside of coding, I find balance in swimming and pastry-making.
